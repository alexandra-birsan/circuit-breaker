Exploring what a circuit breaker is! ðŸš€

"A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage
caused by excess current from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault
is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset
(either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation." - Wikipedia
